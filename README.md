# A TensorFlow implementation of DeepMind's WaveNet paper

This is a TensorFlow implementation of the [WaveNet generative neural
network architecture](https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/) for audio generation.

This implementation is currently still under :construction:

The [VCTK corpus](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jyamagis/page3/page58/page58.html) is currently used.
In order to run the network, you need to download the corpus and unpack it in the same directory as the `run.py` script.

Then, execute
```python
python run.py
```
to train the network.
